            <h1>Storytelling with visualization experiment</h1>
            <p>You will see a series of charts that tell a story. After each step, we will ask you some 
                questions about the charts and story.</p>

            <p>We expect your answers to be between about 3 and 6 sentences long. The whole
                experiment typically takes around one hour. The sequence will contain 
                <strong>10 pages</strong> and a short survey at the end.</p>

            <p>Below you can see an example of a chart. One set of answers is something we would
                consider good. The other answer is something we would consider bad. We will refuse HITs with 3 or more
                bad answers.
            </p>


            <h2>Example visualization</h2>

            <div class="chart">
                <img src="chart.svg" alt="chart"/>
            </div>


            <p class="example">Example of two <strong>good</strong> answers:</p>

            <p class="question-example">What is shown on each axis of this chart?</p>
            <p class="answer-example">Y: International aid donations in billion USD,  X: Years</p>

            <p class="question-example">What can you conclude from this chart?</p>
            <p class="answer-example">Over time new countries have started donating to international aid. Between 
                2005 and 2010 there has been a sharp peak of donations because South Korea 
                and India have started to donate large sums. After 2010 many countries have 
                strongly reduced their donations. This could be a result of of the financial crisis.</p>


            <p class="example">Example of a <strong>bad</strong> answer:</p>
            <p class="question-example">What can you conclude from this chart?</p>
            <p class="answer-example">countries and international aid donations</p>
